## Objective


In this lab, you will work as Sofía to integrate Amazon Cognito into the café website. Frank wants to be able to log in and request a coffee bean inventory report directly from the café website. Amazon Cognito provides an authentication service, which Sofía wants to use for this website enhancement. This usability enhancement will use the state machine that you built in the previous lab using AWS Step Functions.

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

Create an Amazon Cognito user pool
Create an Amazon Cognito user pool user
Configure an app client to use Amazon Cognito as an authentication service
Integrate an Amazon Cognito app client into a website
Update REST API endpoints that are built with Amazon API Gateway to call Amazon Cognito for authentication purposes
Configure an API Gateway authorizer
Duration
This lab will require approximately 90 minutes to complete.


AWS service restrictions
In this lab environment, access to AWS services and service actions might be restricted to the ones that are needed to complete the lab instructions. You might encounter errors if you attempt to access other services or perform actions beyond the ones that are described in this lab.
